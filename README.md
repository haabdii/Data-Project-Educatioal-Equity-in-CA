# Data-Project: Educatioal-Equity-in-CA
This is a jupyetr notebook of a data project that I built using a dataset provided by OkCupid, an online dating app. This project serves as my capstone project for the following course on Codeacademy: Getting Started with Machine Learning. Codeacademy provided with the dataset and general guidelines on how to do the project. All the work reported in the notebook including the problem definition, cleaning, reducing and preparing the data and the exploratory data analysis is original.
