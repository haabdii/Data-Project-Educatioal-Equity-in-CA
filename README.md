# On Educatioal Equity in CA

In this project, I looked at the educational equity in CA based on the information on age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and education level of approximately 50000 individuals using a dataset provided by OkCupid, an online dating app. 

It turns out that ethnicity has a more significant effect on the education level distribution than gender and sexual orientation. On average, whites and asians have a higher level of education than other ethnicities.
